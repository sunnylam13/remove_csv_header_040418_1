# Remove Header from CSV Files

This program removes the first line from CSV files, often the header row.  It opens every file with the `.csv` extension in the current working directory, reads in the contents and rewrites the contents without the first row...  all to a file of the same name.  This replaces the old contents of the CSV file with the new, headless content.
